# Java-Practice-RPG
I am refreshing my memory of Java's OOP and data structures by creating the bare bones of a RPG game. The goal isn't to make a fully fledged game though I might add graphical elements later down the line to learn GUI design in Java.
### Non-exhaustive list of things I want to add:
<ul>
  <li> Fleshing out the battle mechanic: 
    <ul>
      <li> more attack options </li>
      <li> turn-based status effects </li>
      <li> elemental buffs/nerfs </li>
      <li> player/monster party combat priority </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Being able to traverse the overworld </li>
  <li> Stats Menu and Allocation </li>
  <li> Add Shop Room and Dialogue Room </li>
</ul>
